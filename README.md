# Functions-with-Variables-and-I-O
Introduction to basic functions for input handling and the use of variable for computations and output. 


# Description: You are asked to provide:
- Your program should request that the user enter a value for the length and width of a room.
- Your program should request the whole number cost of a bottle of special floor sealant.
- Your program should then compute the area of room, the number of liters of sealant required to cover the floor, and the number of bottles.
- Your program should output, in a descriptive format, the area, number of liters, number of bottles, and the total cost of the floor sealant. Note: Sealant comes in 2L bottles and each liter of sealant will cover 6m.
- You should use your PSID to provide the input. Alternating digits should be used to create the length and width of the room, for example: for a PSID of 12345 the length would be 135 and the width 24. The cost of a bottle of sealant should be the sum of the digits, for example: for a PSID of 12345, the cost per bottle would be 1+2+3+4+5 = 15.
